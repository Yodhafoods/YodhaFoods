                At <strong>Yodha Foods</strong>, sourcing is not just a supply chain
                activity — it is a responsibility. We believe that the quality of food
                begins at the source, and every ingredient must meet our standards for
                purity, traceability, and integrity.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
                We work with trusted suppliers, farmer networks, and aggregators who
                share our commitment to clean, single-ingredient food products. Our
                focus is on sourcing raw materials that are:

            <p className="text-gray-700">
                Ingredients used in Yodha Foods products — including fruits, vegetables,
                and herbs — are selected based on seasonal availability, freshness, and
                suitability for traditional dehydration methods.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mt-3">
                We prioritize ingredients that retain their natural aroma, color, and
                nutritional profile after processing.

            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
                Once sourced, ingredients are cleaned, sorted, and processed using
                controlled dehydration techniques designed to preserve quality without
                chemical intervention.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mt-3">
                We do not add artificial preservatives, fillers, or synthetic agents
                during processing.
